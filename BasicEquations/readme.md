# Random Equations

Not really a czech dataset, but something I needed to generate for target practice purposes.

Format:

```
operand1 OPERATOR operand2 = ? | (sign)equation-result
```

Inside the script, count, output filename and "higher bound" for random numbers can be set up. By default, multiplication and truedivision are disabled, because virtually no one calculates random equation of this caliber in their heads for target practice.
